INTRODUCTION
Venezuelaâ€™s economic crisis began from 2013, the country that relied solely on oil wealth. Being, highly reliant on oil, the oil market dipped from 2014 leading to various 
economical situations that increased crime, food shortages, healthcare systems collapsing and the need for accurate medicines for treatment. From a public healthcare perspective, 
the Venezuelan government has stopped monitoring and publishing fundamental and key health statistics for evaluating the public health of the population in line with health 
guidelines, standards and public policies. (C4V) As a result, acute understanding from the data available is needed to create a domain-specific hypotheses, that enables the 
health-care professionals to identify the cause of disease outbreaks and determine the progression of diseases.
